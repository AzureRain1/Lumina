# Lumina

Lumina is aimed at being a small, high-performance and easily extensible framework for interacting with FINAL FANTASTY XIV game data. There's also an emphasis on making the library self contained without extraneous and unnecessary dependencies with a code-base that is easy to work with and maintain.

* Modular file implementation
* High-performance and relational access to Excel data
* Background file loading
